Lesson 4

4.1

Pronomial possession is indicated by inserting a bound form of the appropriate pronoun between the definite article and the noun so modified. It is best to learn the form, i.e. the article plus the pronoun, as a unit:

			masc. sing. noun			fem. sing. noun
sg. 1 com. 	ⲠⲀⲈⲒⲰⲦ		my father 		ⲦⲀⲘⲀⲀⲨ		my mother
	2 masc.	ⲠⲈⲔⲈⲒⲰⲦ		your father		ⲦⲈⲔⲘⲀⲀⲨ		your mother
	2 fem.	ⲠⲞⲨⲈⲒⲰⲦ		your father 	ⲦⲞⲨⲘⲀⲀⲨ		your mother
	3 masc.	ⲠⲈϤⲈⲒⲰⲦ		his father		ⲦⲈϤⲘⲀⲀⲨ		his mother
	3 fem.	ⲠⲈⲤⲈⲒⲰⲦ		her father		ⲦⲈⲤⲘⲀⲀⲨ		her mother
pl. 1 com.	ⲠⲈⲚⲈⲒⲰⲦ		our father		ⲦⲈⲚⲘⲀⲀⲨ 	our mother
	2 com.	ⲠⲈⲦⲚ̄ⲈⲒⲰⲦ 	your father		ⲦⲈⲦⲚ̄ⲘⲀⲀⲨ	your mother
	3 com.	ⲠⲈⲨⲈⲒⲰⲦ		their father	ⲦⲈⲨⲘⲀⲀⲨ		their mother

		plural noun (my brothers, etc.)
sg. 1 com.	ⲚⲀⲤⲚⲎⲨ
    2 masc.	ⲚⲈⲔⲤⲚⲎⲨ
    2 fem.	ⲚⲞⲨⲤⲚⲎⲨ
    3 masc.	ⲚⲈϤⲚⲎⲨ
    3 fem.	ⲚⲈⲤⲤⲚⲎⲨ
pl. 1 com.	ⲚⲈⲚⲤⲚⲎⲨ
	2 com.	ⲚⲈⲦⲚ̄ⲤⲚⲎⲨ
	3 com.	ⲚⲈⲨⲤⲚⲎⲨ

Note that there is a gender distinction in the second and third persons of the singular, but not of the plural. This is characteristic of all pronomial paradigms in Coptic. The term "common" (com.) refers to forms or categories where no gender distinction is made.

4.2 The nearer demonstrative "this" is expressed by the forms

masc. sing.	ⲠⲈⲒ-		fem. sing.	ⲦⲈⲒ-		com. pl.	ⲚⲈⲒ-

prefixed directly to the noun:

ⲠⲈⲒⲢⲰⲘⲈ	this man
ⲦⲈⲒⲤϨⲒⲘⲈ		this woman
ⲚⲈⲒⲤⲚⲎⲨ		these brothers

After a noun with a demonstrative adjective the genitive is usually expressed by Ⲛ̄ⲦⲈ, as in

ⲠⲈⲒϪⲰⲰⲘⲈ Ⲛ̄ⲦⲈ ⲠⲀⲤⲞⲚ	this book of my brother('s)

4.3 The pronomial element -ⲔⲈ- inserted between the article and the noun expresses "other":

ⲠⲔⲈⲢⲰⲘⲈ	the other man	Ⲛ̄ⲔⲈⲢⲰⲘⲈ	the other men

-ⲔⲈ- may also be used after demonstrative or possessive prefixes:

ⲠⲈⲒⲔⲈⲢⲰⲘⲈ	this other man	ⲠⲀⲔⲈϪⲞⲒ	my other ship

-ⲔⲈ- is not inflected for number or gender in this usage.
