Lesson 3

3.1 Relative Clauses

A we shall see in subsequent lessons, relative clauses in Coptic exhibit a variety of forms, depending on the type of predication involved. In the present lesson we shall consider only those relative clauses associated with sentences with adverbial  predicates. Note the transformation

ⲠⲢⲰⲘⲈ ϨⲘ̅ ⲠⲎⲒ -> (ⲠⲢⲰⲘⲈ) ⲈⲦ ϨⲘ̅ ⲠⲈⲒ

The man is in the house -> (The man) who is in the house

The relative pronoun ⲈⲦ functions here as the subject of the relative clause; it is not inflected for number or gender:

ⲦⲈⲤϨⲒⲘⲈ ⲈⲦ ϨⲒ ⲦⲈϨⲒⲎ  the woman who is on the road
Ⲛ̅ϨⲖ̅ⲖⲞ ⲈⲦ ϨⲚ̅ ⲐⲈⲚⲈⲈⲦⲈ  the monks who are in the monastery

Negation is with ⲀⲚ: Ⲛ̅ϨⲖ̅ⲖⲞ ⲈⲦ ϨⲚ̅ ⲐⲈⲚⲈⲈⲦⲈ ⲀⲚ.

Relative clauses cannot be used to modify an indefinite noun. This is an *important general rule* of Coptic.

Any relative clause may be substantivized, i.e. converted to the status of a noun, by prefixing the appropriate form of the definite article:

ⲠⲈⲦ ϨⲘ̅ ⲠⲎⲒ     the one who (he who, that which) is in the house
ⲦⲈⲦ ⲘⲚ̅ ⲠϢⲎⲢⲈ  the one (f.) who is with the boy
ⲚⲈⲦ ϨⲒ ⲠϪⲞⲒ    those who (those things which) are on the ship

Such constructions may refer to persons or things, depending on the context.

The relative clause ⲈⲦ Ⲙ̅ⲘⲀⲨ, who (which) is there, is used to express the further demonstrative "that":

ⲠⲢⲰⲘⲈ ⲈⲦ Ⲙ̅ⲘⲀⲨ  that man
ⲚⲈⲬⲎⲨ ⲈⲦ Ⲙ̅ⲘⲀⲨ  those ships

3.2 Greek Nouns

The typical Coptic text contains a large number of Greek loanwords. Greek masculine and femenine nouns retain their gender; Greek neuter nouns are treated as masculine:

ο αγγελος	ⲠⲀⲄⲄⲈⲖⲞⲤ	the angel
η επιστολη	ⲦⲈⲠⲒⲤⲦⲞⲖⲎ	the letter
η φυχη		ⲦⲈⲮⲨⲬⲎ		the soul
το πυευμα	ⲠⲈⲠⲚⲈⲨⲘⲀ	the spirit
το δωρου	ⲠⲀⲰⲢⲞⲚ		the gift

Greek nouns appear in the nominative singuler form of Greek and are usually not inflected in any way. Occasionally, however, a Coptic plural ending is added to a Greek noun:

Ⲛ̅ⲈⲠⲒⲤⲦⲞⲖⲞⲞⲨⲈ	the letters
ⲚⲈⲮⲨⲬⲞⲞⲨⲈ		the souls

The Greek noun η ϑαλασσα (the sea) was borrowed as Ⲧ.ϨⲀⲖⲀⲤⲤⲀ, i.e. θ was taken as the definite article plus ϩ. Thus, "a sea" is ⲞⲨϨⲀⲖⲀⲤⲤⲀ.

Initial χ, φ, ϑ, ψ, ξ of Greek nouns are considered two consonants in attaching the definite article (cf. Intro. , p. x).

ⲦⲈ.ⲬⲰⲢⲀ			the country
ⲚⲈ.ⲪⲒⲖⲞⲤⲞⲪⲞⲤ	the philosopher
ⲦⲈ.ⲮⲨⲬⲎ			the soul
ⲦⲈ.ⲐⲨⲤⲒⲀ		the offering
