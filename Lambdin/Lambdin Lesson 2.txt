Lesson 2

2.1 The indefinite article

The indefinite article for nouns of either gender is ⲟⲩ in the singular, ϩⲉⲛ in the plural, prefixed directly to the noun:

ⲟⲩϫⲟⲓ  a ship
ⲟⲩⲣⲱⲙⲉ a man
ⲟⲩϩⲓⲏ a road

ϩⲉⲛⲉϫⲏⲩ ships, some ships
ϩⲉⲛⲣⲱⲙⲉ men, some men
ϩⲉⲛϩⲓⲟⲟⲩⲉ roads, some roads

The plural indefinite article may be translated as "some, certain" or be omitted entirely in translation, as the context requires. The plural indefinite article is frequently written as ϩⲛ̄ and is easily confused with the preposition ϩⲛ̄. In the exercises to the lessons we shall always distinguish between the two, but in part of the Reading Selections the orthography of the source is maintained.

Because the use of the Coptic articles, both definite and indefinite, corresponds closely to the use of the articles in English, only exceptions to this general correspondence will be noted in the following lessons when appropriate. References to the omission of the article require special attention. For the present lesson note that indefinite nouns designating unspecific quantities of a substance require an indefinite article in Coptic where there is none in English:

ⲟⲩⲙⲟⲟⲩ water
ϩⲉⲛⲟⲉⲓⲕ bread
ϩⲉⲛⲁϥ meat

The choice between the singular and plural article here is lexical, i.e. it depends on the particular noun. All such nouns, if definite and specific, may of course appear with the definite article: ⲡⲙⲟⲟⲩ, ⲡⲟⲉⲓⲕ, ⲡⲁϥ. Abstract nouns, such as ⲙⲉ truth, often appear with either article (ⲟⲩⲙⲉ, ⲧⲙⲉ) where English employs no article.
